What is Cache:
If we simply answer the question of what is cache, it is data stored on a server for future reuse.
How exactly does cache work?
When you open a site, all website data is collected in cache, converted into an HTML file and opened in your browser.
A copy of the cache will be loaded the next time you open the same site. This will help the server load faster and avoid overload.
Of course, if the website has been updated, this process will start over.
Two things to keep in mind are firstly that not all websites use caches, and the second is that the cache may expire or be manually deleted. 
Now that you know what cache is, it matters next. Cache plays an important role in website loading speed . This will make your website perform better as your visitors won't wait long for your website to load.
Less processing for HTTP requests means less bandwidth will be used. This is a good thing, especially if you have limited resources.
