The things I’ve learned in the past five years can’t be compared

“I remember that aside from Li Nanheng, there was also a little brother who often showed up with you, right?” 
Qin Shuke winked at her. “Even when we go out to talk about clients, 
we can complement each other. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely stand 
on the same side and help you take back all the glory
of the Ducheng Corporation.”

"You can count on me.", Qin Shuke asked
Feng Ling smiled. “Then how should I thank you?”
